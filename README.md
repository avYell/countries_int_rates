# countries_int_rates
A analysis of several countries' short term and long term interest rates from 1990 till Early 2019

#### Should be a plotly thing in python

## PART 1
- Show map of world, with the countries with data highlighted in a certain color, depending on the level of data available for the country
- When user hovers over the country, then a chart pops up over the map, with the short term or long term interest rate time series chart (depending on what the user chooses)

## PART 2
- Comparison of historical rates between 2-5 countries and specific type of interest rate.
- One chart, multi-colored lines, use seaborn
- - This also depends on the data, For instance, ISR only has data that's yearly, whereas FRA has quarterly data from 1970 onwards. This must be taken into consideration via a warning to the user.
